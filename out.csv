How do different contexts, such as family, clan and community, national and international relations, affect biblical perspectives on justice? Where do we see biblical writers wrestling with problems posed by the apparent lack of justice? Can there be love without justice, or justice without love?

In studying Steinbeck, Dos Passos and Agee, we will not only look at how the subject materials of their writings reflect these social changes, but also how the authors developed different -- and in some cases strikingly modern -- textual strategies to engage with this tumultuous era of American history.
